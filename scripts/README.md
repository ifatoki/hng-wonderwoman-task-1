## Steps to writing your script and integrating it to Github
* The first step is to have git installed on your computer, if you donâ€™t please click [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to read how to install it as that is far beyond the scope of this post.
* Once you have git installed, click on and fork the repository [here](https://github.com/ifatoki/hng-wonderwoman-task-1)
* After forking the repository, clone the repository to your local computer. You can do this by typing in your console `git clone [link-to-your-forked-version-of-the-repo]`
* Next up you navigate into the **scripts** folder in the cloned repository by typing `cd hng-wonderwoman-task-1/scripts`
* Confirm you are in the **develop** branch by typing `git checkout develop`
* Create a new file this directory. The name of the file should be *[HNG_ID]-[slack-username].[file_ext]* for example `1324-itunuloluwa.js` **OR** copy the script you have already written into the folder **AND** name it to match the format above.
* The file should contain your code written in **python, javascript or php** that prints *"Hello World, this is [full name] with HNGi7 ID [ID] using [language] for stage 2 task"*
* Save the file and commit your changes.
* Push your changes back to your fork in Github by doing a `git push`.
* On Github, create a new pull pull request to the **develop** branch in the base repository (**ifatoki/hng-wonderwoman-task-1**).

Once this is done, the PR would be merged.

*PLEASE BE SURE NOT TO MODIFY ANY OTHER FILES OTHER THAN YOUR SCRIPT FILE AS THIS COULD DELAY THE MERGE OF YOUR PR.*
